Download from https://altstore.io/altserver/beta/**\n\nIMPORTANT\niOS 13.5 (due for release soon) changes how active apps are counted. Previously, app extensions counted towards the 3 active app limit, and inactive apps could remain installed without counting. Now, app extensions are excluded, but inactive apps must be uninstalled to not count.\n\nOn devices running iOS 13.5 or later, apps will now be backed up & uninstalled when deactivated. When you later activate an inactive app, AltStore will reinstall the app and restore its data so you can continue using it as if it was never uninstalled.\n\nNOTE: This does not affect devices running iOS 13.4.1 or earlier.",
